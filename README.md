***About Firewall Feed***

Firewall Feed is a web based free tool that assists you to build your own IP address feed in your local network. 

The tool facilitates maintaining IP addresses in a text file. As and when needed, you can add or remove IP address in the text file. 
Most Next Generation firewalls support reading of such text files on regular intervals, so you can further enforce in firewall security policies to either allow or block traffic to these IP addresses. 
Hence you donâ€™t need to make configuration change or commit on the firewall every time.

Yes, you are right. Firewall Feed is similar to spamhaus and other blocklists available on internet, but Firewall Feed is your own IP address feed that is running on your local LAN.


***Installation***

All you need is 
- a Web server supporting PHP (of any version). No database is needed. No special folder permission needed.
- extract files and copy to a web server folder.
That's it.

***How to use?***

* Use "Add IP to Feed" page, as and when you add IP addresses, it gets appended to a text file.

* Use "View Feed" page to view text file entries. "View Feed" page url is the one that you need to configure in firewall appliance to read on regular interval.
